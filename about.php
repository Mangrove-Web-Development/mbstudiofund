                <a href="https://www.gdc.net/foundation/about">GDC Foundation</a> and seven Manitoba design studios have come together to provide two annual scholarships, from the Manitoba Studio Fund, to support historically marginalized students, Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour, (BIPOC), who are pursuing a degree or certificate in the field of design and design communications.
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Manitoba Studio Fund was created by and for designers, to assist students from traditionally racialized and disenfranchised communities in the province.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The Scholarships
            </h2>
            <p>
                Two scholarships of $2,000 each are to be awarded: one to a student at the University of Manitoba, and one to a student at Red River College. The successful applicants will have applied in proper form to the GDC Foundation Scholarship program. The awards will be applied directly to the students’ tuitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Manitoba Studio Fund Scholarship Award recipients were announced in July 2021. Please see more information in our <a href="news.php">News</a> section.

                <p class="bold">The recipients of funding will also be awarded a paid work placement, or internship, at a studio or agency so that they can benefit from the first-hand experience and opportunities that come with being an integral part of a design practice.</p>
                <h2>Who can apply</h2>
                <p>This scholarship is available for BIPOC Graphic Design, UX/UI and Digital Media students. It is available to students in Manitoba who are attending either the University of Manitoba or RRC Polytech.</p>
